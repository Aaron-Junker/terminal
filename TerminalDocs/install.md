## Installing and running Windows Terminal

> Note: Windows Terminal requires Windows 10 1903 (build 18362) or later

### Microsoft Store [Recommended]

Install the [Windows Terminal from the Microsoft Store][store-install-link].
This allows you to always be on the latest version when we release new builds
with automatic upgrades.

This is our preferred method.

### Other install methods

#### Via GitHub

For users who are unable to install Windows Terminal from the Microsoft Store,
released builds can be manually downloaded from our repository's [Releases
page](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/releases).

Download the `Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_<versionNumber>.msixbundle` file from
the **Assets** section. To install the app, you can simply double-click on the
`.msixbundle` file, and the app installer should automatically run. If that
fails for any reason, you can try the following command at a PowerShell prompt:

```powershell
# NOTE: If you are using PowerShell 7+, please run
# Import-Module Appx -UseWindowsPowerShell
# before using Add-AppxPackage.

Add-AppxPackage Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_<versionNumber>.msixbundle
```

> Note: If you install Terminal manually:
>
> * Terminal will not auto-update when new builds are released so you will need
>   to regularly install the latest Terminal release to receive all the latest
>   fixes and improvements!

#### Via Windows Package Manager CLI (aka winget)

[winget](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) users can download and install
the latest Terminal release by installing the `Microsoft.WindowsTerminal`
package:

```powershell
winget install --id=Microsoft.WindowsTerminal -e
```

#### Via Chocolatey (unofficial)

[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) users can download and install the latest
Terminal release by installing the `microsoft-windows-terminal` package:

```powershell
choco install microsoft-windows-terminal
```

To upgrade Windows Terminal using Chocolatey, run the following:

```powershell
choco upgrade microsoft-windows-terminal
```

If you have any issues when installing/upgrading the package please go to the
[Windows Terminal package
page](https://chocolatey.org/packages/microsoft-windows-terminal) and follow the
[Chocolatey triage process](https://chocolatey.org/docs/package-triage-process)

#### Via Scoop (unofficial)

[Scoop](https://scoop.sh) users can download and install the latest Terminal
release by installing the `windows-terminal` package:

```powershell
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install windows-terminal
```

To update Windows Terminal using Scoop, run the following:

```powershell
scoop update windows-terminal
```

If you have any issues when installing/updating the package, please search for
or report the same on the [issues
page](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop-extras/issues) of Scoop Extras bucket
